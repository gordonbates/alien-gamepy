## User Story

### Intended Audience

The intended audience is for children (7+) and adults of all ages. 

This is a turn based game where both the Player and Alien start with 100 Health. The players Attack yields 10 damage to the Alien's health whereas the Alien has a dymanic level of attack ranging randomly from 7 to 16! 

The player can opt, instead of an Attack, for a Heal which replenishes health by 12. Let's hope the Alien's return attack is less than 12!!

The first to deplete their health to 0 looses the battle.

# Design

The player is greeted with a Welcome to Alien GamePy message, ASCII Alien Art underneat along with a player name input.

Here's the Player (Dallas) enters his name and 4 actions options are loaded up.

The Player chooses action 1. Attack and we can see the Player recieved 13 damage to his health and the Alien recieved 10 as expected.
